# spring-k8s-recpies

Recipes for deploying Spring + Tanzu products to an empty Kubernetes cluster. 
We provide recpies to deploy the componets below:

* Wavefront proxy for Tanzu Observability
* Tanzu Build Service + Premium Buildpacks
* Tanzu Postgres Operator
* Tanzu RabbitMQ Operator
* Tanzu GemFire Operator
* Spring Cloud Services for Kubernetes
* Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes
* Spring Cloud Dataflow for Kubernetes
* Spring Boot Operator
* VMware Spring Runtime Support


The main idea is to provide guidance for an application development team writing
apps in Spring and deploying them to Kubernetes.
